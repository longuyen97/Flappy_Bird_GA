# Genetic Flappy Bird

The last output of the neural networks will be activated with a sigmoid function, determines if the bird shall jump.

##### Neural network with no hidden layer. Only an input layer and an output layer.

The brain capacity of each bird is very small and the population has great difficulty to learn to survive.

##### Neural network with one hidden layer. 

With already one more brain layer, the fittest bird can already beats the game after a few generations, achieving the immortality.
